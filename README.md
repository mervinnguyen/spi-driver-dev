# Custom SPI Driver for Embedded Systems

This project implements a custom Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) driver tailored for embedded systems development. 
It is designed to facilitatecommunication between the microcontroller and peripheral devices over SPI, with emphasis 
on modularity, low-level register access, and efficient data transfer. 

## 📌 Features

-SPI Master mode support
-Full-duplex communication
-Configurable clock polarity (CPOL) and phase (CPHA)
-Manual or DMA-based data transfer
-Interrupt and polling-based transmission
-Chip Select (CS) management
-Initialization, configuration, and cleanup functions
